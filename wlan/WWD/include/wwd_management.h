 * WICED Initialisation Function
 *
 * - Initialises parts of the hardware platform used for Wi-Fi control
 *   including pins for : SDIO/SPI, interrupt, reset, power etc.
 * - Initialises the WICED thread (which arbitrates access to the SDIO/SPI bus)
 * - Sets the country code to set which radio channels are allowed
 * - Clear the events mask
 * - Bring the Wireless interface to the 'Up' state
 * - Turn off minimum power consumption feature to avoid SDIO timeouts
 *
 * @param country : enumerated country identifier, which sets the allowed
 *                  radio channels according to country regulations
 * @param buffer_interface_arg : abstract parameter which is passed
 *                        to the buffer interface during init.
 *                        Look in @ref host_buffer_init for details
 *                        of the argument required for your particular buffering system
 *
 * @return WICED_SUCCESS if initialization is successful, WICED_ERROR otherwise
