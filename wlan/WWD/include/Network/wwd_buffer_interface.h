 * concern WICED, however it must match the way the network stack expects packet
 * buffers to be allocated.

 * @param buffer     A pointer which receives the allocated packet buffer handle
 * @param direction : Indicates transmit/receive direction that the packet buffer is
 *                    used for. This may be needed if tx/rx pools are separate.

 * @param add_remove_amount : This is the number of bytes to move the current pointer
 *                            of the packet buffer - a negative value increases the space
 *                            for headers at the front of the packet, a positive value
