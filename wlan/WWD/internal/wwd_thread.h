/** @file
 *  The Wiced Thread allows thread safe access to the Wiced hardware bus
 *  This is an Wiced internal file and should not be used by functions outside Wiced.
 *
 *  This file provides prototypes for functions which allow multiple threads to use the Wiced hardware bus (SDIO or SPI)
 *  This is achieved by having a single thread (the "Wiced Thread") which queues messages to be sent, sending
 *  them sequentially, as well as receiving messages as they arrive.
 *
 *  Messages to be sent come from the wiced_send_sdpcm_common function in SDPCM.c .  The messages already
 *  contain SDPCM headers, but not any bus headers (GSPI), and are passed to the wiced_thread_send_data function.
 *  This function can be called from any thread.
 *
 *  Messages are received by way of a callback supplied by in SDPCM.c - wiced_process_sdpcm
 *  Received messages are delivered in the context of the Wiced Thread, so the callback function needs to avoid blocking.
 *
